    <p>We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., when communicating by e-mail) can have security gaps. Complete protection of data from access by third parties is not possible.</p>

    <h3>Notice concerning the responsible party</h3>
    <p>The responsible party for data processing on this website is:</p>
    <p>Philipp Kraatz<br />

    <h3>Storage Duration</h3>
    <p>Unless a more specific storage period has been stated within this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data processing ceases to apply. If you make a legitimate request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial law retention periods); in the latter case, deletion occurs after these reasons cease to apply.</p>

    <h3>General Information on the Legal Bases of Data Processing on This Website</h3>
    <p>If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 Para. 2 lit. a GDPR if special categories of data are processed according to Art. 9 Para. 1 GDPR. In the case of express consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing is also carried out on the basis of Art. 49 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to the access to information in your end device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), data processing is additionally carried out on the basis of ยง 25 Para. 1 TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is necessary for the fulfillment of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data if it is necessary for the fulfillment of a legal obligation on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. c GDPR. Data processing can also be carried out on the basis of our legitimate interest according to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The relevant legal bases in each individual case are explained in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.</p>

    <h3>Recipients of Personal Data</h3>
    <p>In the course of our business activities, we work with various external parties. In some cases, it is also necessary to transfer personal data to these external parties. We only disclose personal data to external parties if this is necessary in the context of contract fulfillment if we are legally obliged to do so (e.g., transfer of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest according to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR in the transfer, or if another legal basis allows the data transfer. When using processors, we only pass on personal data of our customers on the basis of a valid data processing agreement. In the case of joint processing, a joint processing agreement is concluded.</p>

    <h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
    <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke an already given consent at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>

    <h3>Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and to Direct Advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>
    <p>IF DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6 PARA. 1 LIT. E OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING THAT OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASSERTING, EXERCISING, OR DEFENDING LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION ACCORDING TO ART. 21 PARA. 1 GDPR).</p>
    <p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR SUCH ADVERTISING PURPOSES; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL THEN NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING PURPOSES (OBJECTION ACCORDING TO ART. 21 PARA. 2 GDPR).</p>

    <h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority</h3>
    <p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, particularly in the Member State of their habitual residence, their place of work, or the place of the alleged violation. The right to lodge a complaint is without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy.</p>

    <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
    <p>You have the right to have data that we process based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract automatically delivered to yourself or a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another responsible party, this will only be done to the extent technically feasible.</p>

    <h3>Information, Correction, and Deletion</h3>
    <p>Within the scope of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipients, and the purpose of the data processing and, if applicable, a right to correction or deletion of this data. For this purpose, as well as for further questions on the subject of personal data, you can contact us at any time.</p>

    <h3>Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
    <p>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. You can contact us at any time regarding this. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored with us, we usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the verification, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
        <li>If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.</li>
        <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend, or assert legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.</li>
        <li>If you have filed an objection pursuant to Art. 21 para. 1 GDPR, a balance must be struck between your and our interests. As long as it is not yet determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, such data may โ apart from being stored โ only be processed with your consent or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or of a member state.</p>

    <h3>SSL or TLS Encryption</h3>
    <p>For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or inquiries you send to us as the site operator, this site uses SSL or TLS encryption. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the address line of the browser switching from "http://" to "https://" and the lock symbol in your browser line.</p>
    <p>If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>

    <h3>Objection to Advertising Emails</h3>
    <p>We hereby object to the use of contact data published within the scope of the imprint obligation for sending unsolicited advertising and information materials. The operators of these pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of the unsolicited sending of advertising information, such as spam emails.</p>


    <h2>4. Data Collection on This Website</h2>

    <h3>Server Log Files</h3>
    <p>The provider of these pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files, which your browser automatically transmits to us. These are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Browser type and browser version</li>
        <li>Operating system used</li>
        <li>Referrer URL</li>
        <li>Hostname of the accessing computer</li>
        <li>Time of the server request</li>
        <li>IP address</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These data are not merged with other data sources.</p>
    <p>The collection of these data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the technically error-free presentation and optimization of its website โ for this, the server log files must be collected.</p>

    <h3>Inquiry by Email</h3>
    <p>If you contact us by email your inquiry, including all resulting personal data (name, inquiry), will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. We do not pass these data on without your consent.</p>
    <p>The processing of these data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR if your request is related to the fulfillment of a contract or necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of the inquiries addressed to us (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR) or on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR) if it has been requested; the consent can be revoked at any time.</p>
    <p>The data you send to us via contact requests remain with us until you request deletion, revoke your consent to storage, or the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g., after your request has been processed). Mandatory statutory provisions โ especially statutory retention periods โ remain unaffected.</p>
